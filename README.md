## Project Description

This project is a **React.js** web application demonstrating a **decentralized music ownership** concept. Users can acquire shares of songs hosted on platforms like Spotify, with the collected funds used for advertising.

**Key Functionalities:**

* Purchase shares of songs from a simulated marketplace.
* Utilize the collected funds for promotional purposes (placeholder information about $8,000 generating 10 BILLION YouTube impressions).
* Simulate music streaming revenue from services like Spotify and Apple Music.
* Distribute streaming royalties proportionally to shareholders through a smart contract (smart contract functionality not currently implemented).

## Development and Deployment

This project leverages React.js, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
